# EmuTarkov-EmuLib
EmuTarkov-EmuLib

## Requirements
- Escape From Tarkov 0.12.3.5985
- Visual Studio 2017
- .NET Framework 4.6.1

## Setup
Just open it with VS2017, build, and drop the EmuLib.dll into your `<gamedir>/EscapeFromTarkov_Data/Managed/` folder.

## Remarks
This only works with a cleaned assembly-csharp.dll which edits as the project relies on the obfuscated DLL for proper hooking.
